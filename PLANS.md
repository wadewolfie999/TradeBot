# TradeBot Planning System

## Purpose And Authority

- Purpose: define when and how implementation plans are authored, approved, executed, resumed, closed, abandoned, or superseded.
- Authority level: active approved plans rank below `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and above `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`.
- Audience: operator, maintainers, Codex, contributors, reviewers, and research agents.
- Related documents: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/WORKFLOW.md`, `docs/HANDOFF.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/decisions/`.

TradeBot uses plans to prevent scope drift, preserve architectural continuity, and make safety-sensitive work resumable across sessions and actors.

## When A Plan Is Required

A plan is required before implementation when work involves any of the following:

- Source behavior changes.
- Architecture or subsystem-boundary changes.
- Financial, order-execution, risk-limit, credential, or live-capable behavior.
- Data schema, replay semantics, timestamp handling, or generated-output semantics.
- New dependencies or toolchain changes.
- Performance claims or benchmark-driven optimization.
- Multi-file changes with unclear sequencing.
- Work that may span sessions or require handoff.
- Any task where rollback or acceptance criteria are nontrivial.

## When A Direct Patch Is Acceptable

A direct patch is acceptable when all are true:

- Scope is small and clear.
- Risk classification is low.
- The change is documentation-only or a narrow correction.
- No public interface, runtime mode, financial behavior, credential handling, or architecture boundary changes.
- Verification is obvious and local.
- No active plan or ADR is contradicted.

Even direct patches must inspect state before mutation and report verification.

## Plan Identifiers

Use stable IDs:

```text
PLAN-YYYYMMDD-short-topic
```

Examples of valid shapes:

- `PLAN-20260606-phase19-revalidation-docs`
- `PLAN-20260606-l2-applybbo-benchmark`

Do not reuse IDs. If a plan is superseded, create a new ID and cross-reference the prior plan.

## Ownership And Review

- Owner: the operator or maintainer accountable for outcome and approvals.
- Implementer: the human or agent making changes.
- Review authority: the operator or designated reviewer who accepts evidence.
- Codex may draft plans and implement approved plans, but does not self-approve financial, architectural, live-trading, commit, push, or release decisions.

## Lifecycle States

- Draft: being written or refined.
- Proposed: ready for operator or review-authority approval.
- Approved: implementation may begin within stated scope.
- In Progress: implementation has started.
- Blocked: progress requires unavailable evidence, approval, access, or dependency.
- Verifying: implementation is complete and checks are running.
- Complete: acceptance criteria and closure evidence are satisfied.
- Superseded: replaced by another plan.
- Abandoned: intentionally stopped without completion.

## Planning Rules

Every plan must state:

- Objective and success criteria.
- Scope and out-of-scope boundaries.
- Dependencies and preconditions.
- Assumptions and invariants.
- Expected files or subsystems to change.
- Implementation steps.
- Verification strategy.
- Rollback strategy.
- Risks and decision points.
- Progress log and deviations.
- Completion evidence.

Plans must not invent repository facts. If evidence is missing, record the uncertainty and define the inspection needed to resolve it.

## Deviation Handling

If implementation discovers a material mismatch with the plan:

- Stop changing affected areas.
- Record the deviation.
- Inspect enough context to understand impact.
- If the deviation affects scope, architecture, financial safety, credentials, tests, or data semantics, request operator approval before proceeding.
- If the deviation is minor and still inside scope, document it in the progress log and final report.

## Session Resumption

Before resuming an active plan:

```sh
git status --short
git branch --show-current
git log --oneline --decorate -n 5
```

Then compare the plan with:

- Current `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`.
- Relevant ADRs.
- Changed files and untracked files.
- Previous handoff in `docs/HANDOFF.md` format, if present.

Resume only from a verified state. If state is ambiguous, create a handoff-style assessment before further mutation.

## Closure Requirements

A plan may be closed only after:

- Scope is implemented or explicitly reduced by approval.
- Acceptance criteria are satisfied.
- Verification commands and outputs are recorded.
- Deviations and unresolved risks are recorded.
- Files changed are listed.
- Documentation updates are complete.
- Rollback path remains understandable.
- Final outcome states whether the plan is complete, superseded, or abandoned.

## Abandoned Or Superseded Plans

Do not delete abandoned or superseded plans if they contain decision-relevant history. Mark status clearly and link the replacement plan or reason for abandonment. Execution history belongs primarily in Git commits, pull requests, issues, and handoffs, not in a growing diary inside `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`.
